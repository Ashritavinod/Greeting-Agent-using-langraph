# Langgraph Simple Greeting Example

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a basic implementation of a state machine using the `langgraph` library.

## Overview

The notebook defines a simple graph with a single node that takes a message as input and adds a greeting to it. This serves as a minimal example to understand the core concepts of `langgraph`, including defining an agent state, creating nodes, adding nodes to a graph, setting entry and finish points, and compiling and invoking the graph.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `langgraph` library
- `IPython` (for displaying the graph visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   cd <repository_name>

   pip install -r requirements.txt
